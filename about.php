</div>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">To dream, to think and to achieve guided by this motive, Engineering College Bikaner (An Autonomous Institution of Govt. of Rajasthan) is striding to pace ahead and touch the culmination of development. Academic excellence, gravity of thought of faculty members, result oriented students and excellent placements are the salient features of Govt. Engineering College Bikaner.

Academic excellence will always be the loadstar of every effort to provide the students the best available pedagogical help. This will certainly aid students to procure the best placement options which are also one of our priority considerations.

Stimulated with this growth and success, there is no reason to believe that this institution will create its own niche on the national map with a stamp of its own. The combined efforts of the whole team is trying to achieve this recognition level as soon as possible.

To substantiate the dream recognition, it is necessary to capitulate on the current trends. Research & Development will be our major work area so that we can contribute towards the technological development society. In addition to this, our aim is to groom our students to fit in present mode of industrial working.
I hope the sincerity of our efforts, the nobleness of our dreams and accuracy of our vision will fruity itself in the form of making this institution a world class.
