     <strong>About Department</strong></h3>
     </div>
     Applied science is a bridge that connects pure, basic science like physics or chemistry with engineering practices. Faculty and students in applied science employ fundamental physical and chemical principles to create innovative new technologies. These novel solutions are then handed off to engineering disciplines to be refined, enhanced and used to address important societal problems.
<br>
<br>

Applied Mathematics offers courses to undergraduate students of various engineering disciplines. The syllabus have been designed in the areas of applied mathematics, computational techniques and statistical testing to impart the sound knowledge of the various mathematical tools used and their applications in the engineering disciplines. Post graduate course M.Sc. Mathematics is also running in the department from last 4 years. The department having 5 regular faculty members out of which 4 are Ph.D. from Govt. University. Total 79 research papers are published in various internation/National journals/Conferences and 6 books are published at department level.
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.G. course M.Sc. Mathematics is running in the department since 2013.
<br>
<br>

Students are regularly involved in N.C.C. , N.S.S, S.A.C, I.S.T.E and participated in many Tech. Feasts and cultural activities.
